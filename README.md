HellO!

This is `Stack 'Em Neptune` - a compact and lightweight version of original `Stack 'Em` that is designed to provide maximum compatibility for most vanilla/modded minecraft versions.
This is done by either ModLoader or Forge entrypoint with some Java reflections performed in some places.

**Why so?** Because original Stack 'Em has so many features (a lot :3) available it'd be hard to port and maintain these features in other minecraft versions. Sorry!

## Features

Available Features:
- **Texture Stacking:** you can use several textures by order simultaneously!
- **Runtime Item Gluing:** now it two texturepacks change the different parts of the same texture (see below), they will be "glued" together.


## Compatibility

Currently, supported versions are:
- **ModLoader `b1.7.3`**: `-ml` suffix.
- **NFC `b1.7.3`**: `-nfc` suffix.

**Stack 'Em Neptune** is a compact and lightweight version of original [**Stack 'Em**](https://modrinth.com/mod/stack-em) mod that is designed to provide maximum compatibility for most vanilla/modded minecraft versions.

This is done by using either ModLoader or Forge entrypoints with some Java reflections performed in some places.

**Why so?** Because original Stack 'Em has so many features (a lot :3) available it'd be hard to port and maintain these features in other minecraft versions. Sorry!

## Features

Available Features:
- **Texture Stacking:** you can use several textures by order simultaneously!
- **Runtime Item Gluing:** now if two texturepacks change the different parts of the same texture (see below), they will be "glued" together.


## Compatibility

For now, supported versions are:
- **ModLoader `b1.7.3`**: `-ml` suffix.
- **NFC `b1.7.3`**: `-nfc` suffix.

More versions coming soon!
